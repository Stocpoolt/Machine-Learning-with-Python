Amazon Web Services e Bundesliga fornecerão análise de jogos em tempo real com “Bundesliga Match Facts Powered by AWS” 

Aprendizado de máquina e analítica da AWS para aprimorar a experiência dos fãs da principal liga de futebol da Alemanha, fornecendo novas estatísticas avançadas, incluindo posições médias e xGoals

Hoje, a Amazon Web Services (AWS), uma empresa do grupo Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) e a Bundesliga alemã estrearão os dois primeiros Bundesliga Match Facts (Fatos de partida da Bundesliga) com tecnologia da AWS durante o jogo de destaque desta noite às 18h30 CET, entre Borussia Dortmund e Bayern Muenchen na televisão aberta em mais de 200 países. As duas novas estatísticas, média de posições e gols esperados (xGoals), fornecerão aos fãs informações mais profundas sobre o estilo de jogo pretendido por uma equipe, com base em análises em tempo real dos dados capturados a partir do rastreamento da localização dos jogadores em campo e na probabilidade de um jogador marcar um gol. A principal liga nacional de futebol da Alemanha aproveitará o conjunto incomparável de serviços em nuvem da AWS, incluindo aprendizado de máquina e análise, para introduzir estatísticas avançadas adicionais em 2020 e nas próximas temporadas. A AWS e a Bundesliga são os primeiros a fornecer essa combinação exclusiva de estatísticas avançadas em tempo real e análises de jogos para fãs de futebol em todo o mundo.
Este comunicado de imprensa inclui multimédia. Veja o comunicado completo aqui: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200526005891/pt/Using Amazon SageMaker, a fully managed service to build, train and deploy machine learning models, the Bundesliga can now assess the probability of a player scoring a goal when shooting from any position on the field with the Bundesliga Match Fact, xGoals.

Os Bundesliga Match Facts são gerados pela coleta de dados dos feeds de vídeo de jogos ao vivo que são transmitidos para a AWS para análise e, em seguida, devolvidos para transmitir aos espectadores ao redor do mundo em tempo real como estatísticas. Essas estatísticas ajudam o público a entender melhor coisas como a estratégia envolvida na tomada de decisões em campo e a probabilidade de um gol para cada jogada. A partir de 26 de maio, as Posições médias estarão disponíveis nas transmissões futuras dos jogos da Bundesliga, enquanto o xGoals estará disponível nos jogos de destaque.

Uma ohada nos dois novos Bundesliga Match Facts powered by AWS

Posições médias (average positions): Agora, os fãs poderão ver o posicionamento dos jogadores de uma equipe em campo e obter informações sobre o estilo de jogo pretendido pela equipe. As Posições médias fornece novas informações com base em análises realizado nos dados capturados pelo rastreamento da localização média de um jogador no campo, que é exibida em tempo real. Este Bundesliga Match Fact permite que os espectadores identifiquem o momento atual em campo e entendam as mudanças táticas. A nova estatística ajudará a identificar se um time está se formando em um estilo de ataque ou defesa, pressionando o meio ou utilizando as laterais. Ao exibir a localização e a posição médias de cada jogador em tempo real, as Posições médias ajudam os fãs a entender as mudanças táticas à medida que o jogo avança.

xGoals: Usando o Amazon SageMaker, um serviço totalmente gerenciado para criar, treinar e implantar modelos de aprendizado de máquina, a Bundesliga agora pode avaliar a probabilidade de um jogador marcar um gol ao arremessar de qualquer posição no campo. A probabilidade de gol é calculada em tempo real para cada chute, a fim de fornecer aos espectadores informações sobre a dificuldade de um chute e a probabilidade de um gol. Para calcular a precisão do xGoals, os modelos de aprendizado de máquina foram treinados analisando 40.000 chutes históricos a gol, além de uma variedade de recursos derivados de dados posicionais, incluindo distância ao gol, ângulo ao gol, velocidade do jogador, número de defensores na linha de tiro e cobertura do goleiro.

""Na Bundesliga, podemos usar essa tecnologia avançada da AWS, incluindo estatísticas, analítica e aprendizado de máquina, para interpretar os dados e fornecer informações mais aprofundadas e melhor entendimento das decisões de frações de segundo em campo"", disse Andreas Heyden, vice-presidente executivo de inovações digitais do DFL Group. ""O uso dos Bundesliga Match Facts permite que os espectadores tenham uma visão mais profunda das principais decisões em cada partida"".

""A AWS está ajudando a Bundesliga a melhorar a experiência de visualização de transmissão, fornecendo informações mais profundas sobre o jogo que não existia anteriormente"", disse Andy Isherwood, vice-presidente e diretor administrativo AWS EMEA. “Com a AWS, a Bundesliga pode fornecer estatísticas em tempo real para prever jogadas e resultados futuros. Essas duas novas estatísticas são apenas o começo do que poderemos oferecer aos fãs de futebol, pois esperamos descobrir novas maneiras de educar, envolver e entreter os espectadores em todo o mundo.”

Os fãs do futebol podem acompanhar todas as últimas ações da Bundesliga, com o Match Facts da AWS, em Bundesliga.com e através dos canais oficiais Facebook, Twitter e Instagram.

The Company is the market leader in the mid-size bus category in Canada where it sells its Vicinity branded buses.William Trainer, Grande West President and CEO, stated, ""As previously reported, our focus for 2019 and 2020 has been on product line expansion and growing our backlog. With the existing and forecasted orders for 2020, Grande West is expecting improved results for the 2020 fiscal year compared to the prior year. Even after taking into consideration the negative effects of the current COVID-19 pandemic on our delivery schedule, the Company is still planning on delivering over 150 buses during 2020. Moving production of Buy America compliant buses to the U.S. has taken longer than anticipated but we are pleased with the progress and quality on our first Buy America compliant buses delivered during the first quarter of 2020. We have noted an improved sales pipeline and increased orderbook for 2020 resulting from a change in management and renewed focus on sales efforts. We are also fast tracking our smaller crossover bus model and are excited for the Vicinity LT to be available for purchase in 2020. The Company is gaining significant momentum and the outlook for Grande West growth remains very positive.""Recent DevelopmentsIn February of 2020, the Company announced that it received a new contract from its exclusive US distributor, Atlanta-based Alliance Bus Group (""ABG"") for new bus orders with a value of approximately $40M CAD. Grande West expects to record revenue and deliver the Purpose-Built Vicinity Buses within the 2020 calendar year. The new buses will replace an old fleet currently operating throughout multiple locations in the USA with a world-class business and bus operator.COVID-19 UpdateIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic and global market volatility, the Company has activated robust business continuity plans to minimize disruptions to business and to adapt to evolving market conditions. The Company's top priority is the health and safety of its staff, customers, and the communities in which it operates. Grande West has taken appropriate precautions in this regard and has continued to deliver parts and services to meet its customers' needs. The Company is following the advice of health authorities in each jurisdiction where it operates. Grande West has implemented social distancing, team separation, and extensive work-from-home initiatives, as well as eliminated all non-essential travel.Management is monitoring the situation very closely and is evaluating the impact the virus will have on the Company's delivery schedule, but at this time Grande West is still on track to deliver a minimum of 150 buses in 2020. Some expected 2020 sales to private operators have been delayed as a result of the pandemic. The Company's manufacturing partner overseas is still operating and currently producing to meet the Company's needs. Our U.S. manufacturing partner has currently temporarily idled operations. This will slow down Buy America production deliveries until the facility is back online. Although deliveries out of the U.S. may be delayed, the purchase orders are firm and are still expected to be delivered in 2020.Our supply chain is currently able to provide us with the necessary components for production and aftermarket part sales but there is a risk of potential disruptions. Our aftermarket parts division will continue operating and servicing all our customers.Grande West has built and delivered five Buy America Vicinity buses in the U.S. and has another 13 Vicinity buses currently scheduled for 2020 deliveries.The Company remains well-positioned to serve its customers. As conditions evolve, Grande West will adjust plans to align with business continuity protocols and ensure employee, customer, and community health and safety are the highest priority. Credit lines remain active, allowing the Company access to capital, however Grande West recognizes that the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and government or customer reactions could ultimately be materially disruptive.Grande West is taking significant actions to control where it can, particularly surrounding costs and capital investments. The Company has started reductions with senior management, where salaries were reduced effective April 1, 2020. The Company has also implemented strict cost containment measures throughout the organization, including freezing recruiting activities and minimizing all discretionary costs. Grande West is taking proactive measures to actively control working capital and retain cash throughout the COVID-19 crisis.William Trainer, President and CEO of Grande West stated, ""We continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely and we are responding swiftly and effectively to protect the interests of our stakeholders. I am confident that our skilled and loyal workforce, the diversification and strength of our business model, and our strong partner relationship will position us well to navigate the current environment.""OutlookManagement expects to maintain its strong market segment leadership position in Canada and continue to make progress in the U.S. with private operators and public transit agencies. The external pressures to ""right size"" vehicles for its application and ridership levels along with the availability of funding in Canada and the U.S. create an ideal environment for Grande West to prosper. Once we are through the current COVID-19 pandemic, the outlook for Grande West, including significant growth in the U.S., remains very positive.During 2017 and 2018, the Company achieved record revenues. We experienced a decline in the backlog during 2018 mainly due to lower order intake, which impacted 2019 results. Bid activity during 2019 was significantly higher than in 2018, which will translate into higher 2020 sales. We are maintaining our strong leadership position in our market segment in Canada and we continue to make progress in the U.S. market. During the first quarter of 2020 we completed and delivered five of our first Buy America orders and others are just completing production. We have received further Buy America orders for deliveries starting in 2020.Funding for transit in the U.S. and Canada is high and it is expected to remain high.In the U.S. the Consolidated Appropriations Act was recently passed and continues historic funding levels with more than $16 billion for public transportation and intercity passenger rail. This legislation includes $13.4 billion for public transportation and $2.6 billion for intercity passenger rail grants and is $1.2 billion more than the previous FY 2019 FAST Act authorization levels.In Canada in 2017, the federal government allocated $21.1 billion over 11 years to transit construction, expansion and rehabilitation. With the re-elected Liberal government, we are now seeing funding being released.Part of our strategic plan is to expand our product line by adding a 100% zero emission electric propulsion system to our existing Vicinity bus models and adding the Vicinity LT bus model to our product lineup. The Vicinity electric bus will place Grande West in an excellent position to capture market share as the demand for zero emissions buses grows. Our smaller LT bus model will provide Grande West access to the high-end cutaway bus market segment. Municipalities of all sizes across Canada and the U.S. along with private operators in multiple sectors are looking for a more robust low floor accessible bus to replace their cutaways.Aftermarket parts sales are expected to continue to increase as Vicinity bus fleets get older and new vehicles are placed into service.Stock OptionsThe Company also announces that it has granted an additional 100,000 incentive stock options to an officer at an exercise price $0.40 for a period of five years. The options will vest in equal tranches every six months over a three year period.Financial Statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis can be accessed at sedar.comConference CallA conference call for interested listeners will be held on Wednesday, May 27 at 11:00 AM EST.

13,2020-05-26 23:17:39.150,2020-05-26 23:17:39.150000+00:00,First iPhone jailbreak in four years released Newly discovered vulnerability allows users to bypass limitations built in by Apple,urn:newsml:reuters.com:20200526:nNRAbw4jty:1,NS:THEGRD,"A newly discovered vulnerability in iPhones allows users to bypass Apple's built-in limitations – known as ""jailbreaking"" – for the first time in four years.The release of a functional jailbreak for iOS 13.5, the latest version of the iPhone operating system, represents a breakthrough for the small community of users who rely on jailbreaks for everything from serious security research to simply running games and software that Apple does not allow on iPhones.It also poses a security problem for the company, since the techniques are in effect the same ones used by malicious attackers to take over targets' devices.As a result, the pseudonymous developers who released the jailbreak have not gone into detail about the exact nature of the vulnerability they are exploiting.Pwn20wnd, the iOS security researcher who discovered the flaw, admitted to Vice that Apple would fix it ""sooner or later"".""That's just the nature of it,"" they added. ""It will most likely take them at least two or three weeks to release a patch. Even when they release a patch, users can downgrade to the previous iOS version for about two weeks usually, and after that the users should stay on their versions so that the jailbreak keeps working.""Typically, iPhones contain a host of security measures that ensure that only software approved by Apple can be downloaded and installed on the devices. The move has a twin purpose: it helps ensure the devices remain difficult to hack, and it gives Apple control of the iOS economy.But the company's restrictive policies about what can be listed on the App Store has long led to demand from some users for ways to install software from other sources. The company does not allow apps that break the law, for instance, preventing gamers from installing ""emulators"" to play retro video games, and it imposes strict limits on what apps can do when running.The first jailbreak was released in 2007, less than six months after the iPhone launched and pre-dating the App Store. Using a vulnerability in Safari, it allowed users to install their own programs.The ability to bypass security limitations is also a powerful draw for malicious hackers, and many jailbreaks have been repurposed as malware, leading to a cat-and-mouse game between Apple's security teams and the developers who try to get around their barriers.In the past few years Apple has been on top, with extra hardware in newer iPhones making it extremely difficult for any code not approved by Apple to be installed.Pwn20wnd told Vice they did not think their success represented a change to that status quo. Instead, iOS was ""just a big target for attackers"", they said. ""Apple is constantly adding more features to iOS that introduce new attack surfaces.""Apple did not reply to a request for comment.Copyright (c) 2020 theguardian.com-NonSyndicated"

As per the report, Apple will partner with Taiwanese company ASE Technology that is rumoured to be responsible for the backend process for the new component.A separate report by DigiTimes also suggests that this alleged sensor will be a component part of biometric measurements. As per this report the ASE Technology is said to apply its SESUB (semiconductor embedded in substrate)-based SiP packaging technology to AirPods.""ASE has combined SiP with embedded AI design for TWS gears, allowing the devices to monitor heart rates, step counts and health conditions and even to conduct intelligent translation and detect head motions, "" said the report.If these reports are to be believed, AirPods with health monitoring features may be coming, however, chances are that they will not be on the next-generation AirPods that are expected to be launched at any time, as per Jon Prosser - the YouTuber who has been quite active and accurate about what Apple is working on in the recent past.Prosser, earlier this month said that Apple is ready with the next-generation AirPods model that the company could launch anytime soon as they are ""ready to ship, "" although there is no clarity if that is the standard AirPods third-gen or second-gen Apple AirPods Pro.While replying to his followers on Twitter, Prosser said that the code-name of the upcoming AirPods neither matches with AirPods X or the alleged over-ear headphones that the company is known to be making since a while now.For Reprint Rights: timescontent.comCopyright (c) 2020 BENNETT,COLEMAN & CO.LTD."

Even though Google has not said anything on the feature but it is expected to make it more convenient for a user to see search results in terms of both videos and web links within the app.(Image courtesy: Reddit)The report claims that the feature seems to be rolling out as a server side update from the company.Just last week, the company rolled out a new feature, called bedtime reminders that is aimed at reducing the video viewing time of users after a certain hour. If this feature is enabled, the YouTube app will notify the viewer to stop watching the video and go to bed.This feature has been made available to both Android and iOS users and is not yet available for those who see YouTube videos on desktop.For users to turn on this feature, they will have to go to the Settings section of the app where they may find 'Remind me when it's time for bed.' Users can simply turn it on or off and even choose a start and end time for the reminder. A user will also get the option to choose whether or not they want the YouTube app to send the bedtime reminder notification while watching a video or wait until the video they are watching is over.In order to do that, users will have to select 'wait until I finish my video to show reminder' when setting up this feature.For Reprint Rights: timescontent.comCopyright (c) 2020 BENNETT,COLEMAN & CO.LTD."

56,2020-05-26 21:30:08.000,2020-05-26 21:30:08+00:00,UPDATE 1-US high-grade corporate bond supply tops US$1trn,urn:newsml:reuters.com:20200526:nL1N2D82BD:1,NS:IFR,"Updates throughoutBy William HoffmanNEW YORK, May 26 (IFR) - Corporate issuers raised over US$1trn in the US investment-grade bond market in less than five months this year, as issuers rushed to raise liquidity in the face of an economic downturn brought on by Covid-19 pandemic, IFR data shows.  The asset class has never seen so much supply in such a short time span. Not only is this the busiest half-year ever with still a month to go before the end of June, but the market is now on course to topping the entire 2019 well before year's end.In what was another busy day for the asset class, nine issuers sold US$18.7bn of bonds on Tuesday, pushing year-to-date volumes past the trillion-dollar mark. After markets fell into disarray amid concerns over the Covid-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve's intervention made all the difference in late March when primary markets bounced back on the promise it would start buying corporate bonds.  Since then, borrowers have flooded the market with new supply, leading to the three busiest volume months on record: US$288.6bn in April, US$256.4bn in March and US$232.8bn in May, according to IFR data.Some of the largest transactions of the year include a US$25bn Boeing bond, US$20bn Oracle bond, US$19bn T-Mobile M&A deal and last week's US$12.5bn AT&T bond. Coming into the year some analysts estimated the market would price just under last year's full-year total of US$1.127trn, but now Citigroup estimates that year-end supply could reach around US$2trn.If that happens, 2020 will see record volumes for the year, easily exceeding the current record of US$1.333trn seen in 2017.However, Hans Mikkelsen, head of US high-grade strategy at Bank of America, foresees the pace of issuance slowing down considerably by the end of June as companies finish paying down revolvers they drew down earlier in the year.  He estimates some US$200bn-US$300bn in supply in the second half of the year, down from earlier estimates of US$500bn.     ""The market is still ok, but we’re getting to the end of the investor base's ability to take down new debt,"" Mikkelsen said. ""I think it’s going to slow down significantly in July ... and past that it’s hard to say how Covid-19 allows businesses to open up.""

Amazon Web Services und die Bundesliga liefern mit „Bundesliga Match Facts Powered by AWS“ Spielanalysen in Echtzeit 

Maschinelle Lern- und Analyseverfahren von AWS zur Verbesserung des Fan-Erlebnisses für Deutschlands höchste Fußball-Liga, die neue erweiterte Statistiken einschließlich Durchschnittspositionen und xGoals liefern

Amazon Web Services (AWS), ein Amazon.com-Unternehmen (NASDAQ: AMZN), und die Deutsche Bundesliga geben heute Abend um 18:30 Uhr MEZ im Rahmen des Highlight-Spiels Borussia Dortmund gegen Bayern München im Fernsehen in über 200 Ländern das Debüt der ersten beiden Bundesliga Match Facts powered by AWS. Die beiden neuen Statistiken, Durchschnittliche Positionen und Erwartete Tore (xGoals), geben den Fans tiefere Einblicke in die beabsichtigte Spielweise einer Mannschaft, basierend auf Echtzeit-Analysen von Daten, die aus der Verfolgung von Spielerpositionen auf dem Spielfeld erfasst wurden, und der Wahrscheinlichkeit, mit der ein Spieler ein Tor erzielt. Die höchste deutsche Fußball-Bundesliga wird das unübertroffene Angebot von AWS an Cloud-Diensten, einschließlich maschinellen Lernens und Analysen, dazu einsetzen, im Jahr 2020 und in den kommenden Spielzeiten zusätzliche erweiterte Statistiken einzuführen. AWS und die Bundesliga sind die ersten, die diese einzigartige Kombination aus fortschrittlichen Echtzeit-Statistiken und Spielanalysen für Fußballfans auf der ganzen Welt bereitstellen.

Bundesliga Match Facts werden durch das Sammeln von Daten aus den Live-Spielvideo-Feeds generiert, die zur Analyse in AWS gestreamt und dann den Zuschauern weltweit in Echtzeit als Statistiken zur Verfügung gestellt werden. Diese Statistiken helfen den Zuschauern dabei, Dinge wie die Strategie bei Entscheidungen auf dem Spielfeld und die Wahrscheinlichkeit eines Tores für jeden Schuss besser zu verstehen. Ab dem 26. Mai stehen bei zukünftigen Übertragungen von Bundesliga-Spielen Durchschnittspositionen zur Verfügung, während xGoals bei Highlight-Spielen verfügbar sein wird.

Ein Blick auf die beiden neuen Bundesliga Match Facts powered by AWS

Durchschnittliche Positionen: Die Fans können nun die Position der Spieler einer Mannschaft auf dem Spielfeld sehen und erhalten einen Einblick in die beabsichtigte Spielweise der Mannschaft. Die Durchschnittspositionen bieten auf der Grundlage der Analyse von Daten, die bei der Verfolgung der durchschnittlichen Position eines Spielers auf dem Spielfeld erfasst wurden, neue Erkenntnisse, die dann in Echtzeit angezeigt werden. Diese Bundesliga-Spielbilanz ermöglicht es den Zuschauern, die aktuelle Dynamik auf dem Spielfeld zu erkennen und taktische Veränderungen zu verstehen. Die neue Statistik hilft dabei, festzustellen, ob eine Mannschaft im Angriffs- oder Verteidigungsstil aufgestellt ist, die Mitte nach oben drückt oder die Seiten benutzt. Durch die Anzeige des durchschnittlichen Standorts und der durchschnittlichen Position jedes Spielers in Echtzeit hilft die Durchschnittsposition den Fans, taktische Änderungen im Spielverlauf zu verstehen.

xGoals: Durch den Einsatz von Amazon SageMaker, einem vollständig verwalteten Dienst zur Erstellung, zum Training und zum Einsatz von Machine-Learning-Modellen, kann die Bundesliga nun die Wahrscheinlichkeit einschätzen, mit der ein Spieler ein Tor erzielt, wenn er von einer beliebigen Position auf dem Spielfeld schießt. Die Torwahrscheinlichkeit wird in Echtzeit für jeden Schuss berechnet, um den Zuschauern einen Einblick in die Schwierigkeit eines Schusses und die Wahrscheinlichkeit eines Tores zu geben. Um die Präzision von xGoals zu berechnen, wurden Machine-Learning-Modelle trainiert, indem 40.000 historische Torschüsse zusätzlich zu einer Reihe von Merkmalen analysiert wurden, die aus Positionsdaten abgeleitet wurden, darunter Entfernung zum Tor, Winkel zum Tor, Geschwindigkeit der Spieler, Anzahl der Verteidiger in der Schusslinie und Torhüterabdeckung.

„Wir in der Bundesliga können diese moderne Technologie von AWS, einschließlich Statistik, Analytik und Machine Learning, nutzen, um die Daten zu interpretieren und einen tieferen Einblick und ein besseres Verständnis für die im Bruchteil einer Sekunde auf dem Spielfeld getroffenen Entscheidungen zu erhalten“, sagte Andreas Heyden, Executive Vice President Digital Innovations der DFL-Gruppe. „Der Einsatz von Bundesliga Match Facts ermöglicht es den Zuschauern, einen tieferen Einblick in die wichtigsten Entscheidungen in jedem Spiel zu gewinnen.“

„AWS hilft der Bundesliga, das Fernseherlebnis durch tiefere Einblicke in das Spiel zu verbessern, die es vorher nicht gab“, sagte Andy Isherwood, Vice President und Managing Director EMEA, AWS. „Mit AWS ist die Bundesliga in der Lage, Echtzeit-Statistiken zu liefern, um zukünftige Spiele und Ergebnisse vorherzusagen. Diese beiden neuen Statistiken sind nur der Anfang dessen, was wir den Fußballfans liefern können, denn wir freuen uns darauf, neue Wege zu eröffnen, um die Zuschauer auf der ganzen Welt besser zu informieren, zu begeistern und zu unterhalten.“

Fußballfans können alle aktuellen Bundesliga-Aktionen mit Match Facts powered by AWS auf Bundesliga.com und über die offiziellen Kanäle Facebook, Twitter und Instagram verfolgen.

He also discusses areas where he sees opportunity.Short Link: https://refini.tv/2yEj16EVideo Transcript:Hi everybody. Welcome to Trading at Noon. I am Leah Duncan. More optimism about potential coronavirus vaccines is contributing to gains on Wall Street today. US biotech group Novavax is gaining more than 10% as it enrolls humans to begin testing a vaccine candidate. Merck, meanwhile, said it plans to develop two vaccines. Also, the reopening of the US continues. Some traders returned to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange for the first time since March. The exchange opened its doors to about a quarter of the usual number of workers. They were screened upon entry and asked to avoid public transportation. California, meanwhile, decided to reopen in-store retail businesses and places of worship. On the data front, consumer confidence actually edged higher in the month of May and new home sales in April topped forecasts. Right now, the S&P 500 is up roughly 1.7% with all 11 sectors higher. The Dow is rising 2.4%, led by Raytheon Technologies, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase. The NASDAQ is adding 0.75% with financials having the best day. For more, let's bring in Max Wolff, Managing Partner of Multivariate. Max, a pleasure to have you on the show with me today on this Tuesday. Stocks are rallying, the S&P crossing key 3,000 level, the Dow up 25,000. President Trump touting the gains in the market today. Do you see a further move higher here? Sure, anything's possible. I mean, look, this is clearly now the asylum being run by its inmates and they can do whatever they want to do. And you can get as excited as you can about $4 trillion or $5 trillion worth of buying from the Fed. And the Fed is running around, propping up all the things that should be selling off. And so, this is a rally that doesn't make much sense, that's led by the most vulnerable. And to be confident, you have to believe that the Federal Reserve will eventually have some $100 trillion balance sheet where they have bought everything you ever bought by accident. And an increasing number of highly vulnerable positions that were bought on purpose. If you believe gravity eventually holds, that however beautiful the balloon looks, tossed in the breeze, eventually, the air inside the balloon achieves density that's similar to the air around it and the balloon makes its trip back down to earth. So, no validity here in the fundamentals basis, but this can last a while. Now, the economic data that we've been getting so far has been pretty dismal, Max, in terms of the numbers for the month of April, but we had improvement in consumer confidence today and new home sales. Are you looking at this as signs that the economy has bottomed? No. I'm saying that look, being locked in your house and terrified is much more difficult to survive than being told that it's safe to go back outside, which gives you some euphoria and you have some pent-up demand for sure. The problem is you don't have any income and we haven't even seen what the wounds look like as the water goes out on the legs here. So the head looks okay because it stayed above water and a lot of what a short-term stock market index is, is the attitudes about the future of very wealthy people who may have been substantially disconnected from the realities in the market. But just very clear here, we have not reached the probable bottom. We don't know what lies ahead. We only know that it is a lot worse than the economic situation we had before this began. So, I know we don't want to believe this, and I know the first stage of grieving is denial and we're in it and there's lots of good reason to grieve and there's no good reason for me to be harsh in my judgments, right? That wouldn't help anyone in any way. But this can't last. This is folly.This economic stock market divide, if you will, Max, that we've been seeing, do you think we'll continue to see that for much more time to come. Well, we've seen that largely be the kind of defining story of the last 11 years. So, it has some legs, right? And it's run pretty far. I don't think it would last forever. I mean, the simple way I look at these things, if it's of any value is it basically our earnings are going to come down between 20%, 25% and 40% in the short-term and then at least 10% to 20% in the long term, by which I mean at least a year. That's a very conservative estimate, could be much worse, but that seems reasonable. And we're going to see that well as we generally see a reduction in the multiples when things are tough, right? So, what we're seeing instead is an assumption that earnings come all the way back to and or above where they weren't before. Seems doubtful that it happens really fast. We know that's not going to happen and that somehow sentiment stays up, right? So what we have is an admixture of not admitting how bad it is and getting a lot of stimulus from the Fed. One of the strange ironies here as the Federal Reserve is treating this patient like it's dying, pumping it full of morphine, a defibrillating the heart every five seconds, and the patients saying, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine. Yeah, sure, you could hope for a miracle. But generally when they're hitting you with this much morphine and their zapping your chest every 35 minutes, it's because you're quite, quite a bit far from fine. Let's talk about opportunities in the markets. Max. Are you seeing any areas that you're liking right now, perhaps stemmed even more unloved names?So, I think the consumer defensives are actually kind of cheap here because people have moved on to this sort of overhyped recovery thesis. So, I think some of the sort of boring consumer defensive staples, the soaps, the basic foods, they actually look pretty good. They don't look super expensive because those look like they'll survive for a while. I think given the rising instability in acrimony around the world, the defense names look pretty strong. I think the financials are overvalued here, so I'd be very nervous about those. I think the med space is interesting. I think this sort of healthcare space has some big winners but there's indiscriminate buying in this. I think the hospitals get hit pretty hard. We're starting to see that. And I think people who are relying on various state governments should be selling off, but they're not because the state governments are all telling us that they have plunging receipts and rising demands for various support, which is understandable given the economic circumstance. At very least, we don't have consensus in Washington about bailing out more, right? Maybe a bit from the House, but not from the Senate. So, need both need the president to back this stuff for it to work. So, I feel like steep finances, I would watch very closely to not get kind of pulled into the hype on anything that's too reliant on the states. Last thing is we saw the pace of globalization sort of running in reverse. That's been a key feature since 2016. If the market was paying attention, they would be literally terrified. It would be wise to be terrified of that feature. And that's now proceeding even faster than it was before corona. If you'd look at acrimony between the US and China and major trading blocks around the world, it's everyone for themselves. And that a sort of acceleration of a deglobalizing trend. And just to make it clear to people why I think it's a big deal, 43% of the beleaguered earnings of the S&P 500 last year were for international, right, which means they're exposed to a system in disarray. So real-time production won't work so well going forward because the supply chains are afraid international cooperation is reduced. Earnings are coming down. 41 million Americans have lost their jobs, right? That doesn't go away. You can't wish it away. You can stimulate it into the background and you can hope for the best. And there's nothing wrong with being hopeful, but this is absolutely unsustainable. Interesting stuff there, Max. You raised a lot of very interesting points. What concerns you the most right now?The disconnect, right? So again, I'll use this analogy. This is you visit your uncle, he's had a major heart attack. He's not lying in bed. You get there and he is kicking his head over his heels and doing an incredibly vigorous, high-intensity cross training routine in the room in the hospital. And the part of you says, this is amazing. Uncle Bob is great. Look at this guy. I don't know if I could do that move. And the part of you that's little bit more rational, a little bit more willing to sort of see the situation as it is as opposed to how you hope it is, wow, is this a bad idea? I got to convince this guy to calm down so that the next time I visit him, it's not in a funeral home. That would be the way I would describe this present state of the market. Anything else that you are keeping a close eye on right now? I do think the tech revolution story is real. I think we're going to spend more of our lives online, right? And I think that's interesting, and I think the online names will do well. But I also think that brings to the fore unsettled business about privacy rights. And so, I would be a little bit cautious about being not concerned about privacy. What a lot of people suddenly go online, especially a lot of people doing a lot more online than they're used to, the crime goes online, particularly with high unemployment and inequality, which we now have. So, the worlds criminals will be joining you or are joining you online. And so, I think security is a good area to be invested in. But I also think that issues of privacy and the desire for a little bit more clear rules of the road for online living are coming. And I think some of the big names and tech will be fine, but others were going to have a little bit of a harder time adjusting. The last thing I would say about the markets is when people have no money, they buy less of almost everything. Max Wolff, great to have you on the show. Thank you so much. Thank you. Always a pleasure. Our stocks watch today include United Airlines. It is one of several travel-related firms getting a boost today after reports that Spain and Germany want to ease travel restrictions for the peak summer season. The stock is up more than 10%, but has lost two-thirds of its value this year. And we're also tracking Marvell Tech. Broker Susquehanna raised its price target on the chipmaker's stock. It sees the company benefiting long-term from the move to 5G. However, it sees a weaker environment for network equipment due to coronavirus-driven supply disruptions. Susquehanna raised its price target to $35 from $30 on Marvell. Shares are up 3%. They hit their highest level in more than 14 years earlier in the trading session. Well, that wraps up Trading at Noon on Tuesday. I'm Leah Duncan and this is Reuters. (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2020. Click For Restrictions - http://about.reuters.com/fulllegal.asp"
